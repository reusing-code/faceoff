Humble/locstor
=============

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor)

Version 0.2.2

locstor provides gopherjs bindings for the localStorage API. It allows you to
store and retrieve any arbitrary go data structure, and is intended to be
compiled to javascript with [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs)
and run in the browser. locstor works great as a stand-alone package or in
combination with other [Humble](https://github.com/go-humble) packages.

locstor is written in pure go. It feels like go, follows go idioms when
possible, and compiles with the go tools.


Browser Support
---------------

locstor works with IE9+ (with a
[polyfill for typed arrays](https://github.com/inexorabletash/polyfill/blob/master/typedarray.js))
and all other modern browsers. locstor compiles to javascript via
[gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) and this is a gopherjs
limitation.


Installation
------------

Install locstor like you would any other go package:

```bash
go get github.com/go-humble/locstor
```

You will also need to install gopherjs if you don't already have it. The latest
version is recommended. Install gopherjs with:

```
go get -u github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs
```

You can compile your application to javascript using the `gopherjs build`
command. Run `gopherjs --help` to learn more about the gopherjs command-line
tool.


Example Usage
-------------

### Accessing the localStorage API Directly

Use [`SetItem`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#SetItem) to
store an item in localStorage:

```go
if err := locstor.SetItem('foo', 'bar'); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
```

Use [`GetItem`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#GetItem) to get
an item from localStorage:

```go
item, err := locstor.GetItem('foo')
if err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
fmt.Println(item)
// Output:
//   bar
```

Use [`Key`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#Key) to get the key
for a specific item:

```go
key, err := locstor.Key('bar')
if err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
fmt.Println(key)
// Output:
//   foo
```

Use [`RemoveItem`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#RemoveItem)
to remove an existing item from localStorage:

```go
if err := locstor.RemoveItem('foo'); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
_, err := locstor.GetItem('foo')
fmt.Println(err)
// Output:
//   Could not find an item with the given key: foo
```

Use [`Length`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#Length) to get
the number of items currently in localStorage:

```go
count, err := locstor.Length()
if err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
```

Use [`Clear`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#Clear) to remove
all items from localStorage:

```go
if err := locstor.Clear(); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
```

### Using a DataStore

You can also use a
[`DataStore`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#DataStore), which
is an abstraction layer built on top of localStorage capable of storing and
retrieving arbitrary go data structures, not just strings.

Use
[`NewDataStore`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#NewDataStore) to
create a new `DataStore`. It accepts an `EncoderDecoder` as an argument. There
are two encodings provided out-of-the-box: `JSONEncoding` and `BinaryEncoding`.
You should choose `JSONEncoding` if you want the data stored in localStorage to
be more readable and `BinaryEncoding` if you want the data to take up less
space. You can also provide a custom encoding by implementing the
[`EncoderDecoder`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#EncoderDecoder)
interface.

```go
store := locstor.NewDataStore(JSONEncoding)
```

Use [`Save`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#DataStore.Save) to
save data structures in localStorage:

```go
if err := store.Save("numbers", []int{1, 2, 3}); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
```

Use [`Find`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#DataStore.Find) to
get existing data structures out of localStorage. Find works similarly to
[`json.Unmarshal`](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal) from the
standard library. The second argument to `Find`, called `holder`, is a pointer
to a variable that is capable of holding the decoded data structure. Since in
this case we stored a slice of ints, the type of holder should be `*[]int`.

```go
gotNumbers := []int{}
if err := store.Find("numbers", &gotNumbers); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
fmt.Println(gotNumbers)
// Output:
//   [1 2 3]
```

Use [`Delete`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#DataStore.Delete)
to delete an existing data structure from localStorage:

```go
if err := store.Delete("numbers"); err != nil {
	// Handle err
}
gotNumbers := []int{}
_, err := locstor.Find('numbers', &gotNumbers)
fmt.Println(err)
// Output:
//   Could not find an item with the given key: numbers
```

### Handling Errors

[`ErrLocalStorageNotSupported`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#pkg-variables)
will be returned by any function or method if localStorage is not supported in
the current browser. `ErrLocalStorageNotSupported` is just a variable, so
you can do direct comparisons:

```go
if err := locstor.GetItem("foo"); err != nil {
	if err == locstor.ErrLocalStorageNotSupported {
		// Handle an ErrLocalStorageNotSupported error 
	} else {
		// Handle some other type of error
	}
}
```

[`ItemNotFoundError`](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-humble/locstor#ItemNotFoundError)
is the type of error returned if the item you were looking for does not exist in
localStorage. It is a type that implements the `error` interface and tells you
which key or item was not found. To check if an error is an `ItemNotFoundError`,
you can use a type assertion:

```go
if err := locstor.GetItem("foo"); err != nil {
	if _, ok := err.(locstor.ItemNotFoundError); ok {
		// Handle an ItemNotFoundError error 
	} else {
		// Handle some other type of error
	}
}
```


Testing
-------

locstor uses the [karma test runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html)
to test the code running in actual browsers.

The tests require the following additional dependencies:

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html)
- [karma-qunit](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit)

Don't forget to also install the karma command line tools with `npm install -g karma-cli`.

You will also need to install a launcher for each browser you want to test with,
as well as the browsers themselves. Typically you install a karma launcher with
`npm install -g karma-chrome-launcher`. You can edit the config file at
`karma/test-mac.conf.js` or create a new one (e.g. `karma/test-windows.conf.js`)
if you want to change the browsers that are tested on.

Once you have installed all the dependencies, start karma with
`karma start karma/test-mac.conf.js` (or your customized config file, if
applicable). Once karma is running, you can keep it running in between tests.

Next you need to compile the test.go file to javascript so it can run in the
browsers:

```
gopherjs build karma/go/locstor_test.go -o karma/js/locstor_test.js
```

Finally run the tests with `karma run karma/test-mac.conf.js` (changing the name
of the config file if needed).

If you are on a unix-like operating system, you can recompile and run the tests
in one go by running the provided bash script: `./karma/test.sh`.
